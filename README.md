# SpaceX-Falcon-9-1st-stage-Success-Landing-Prediction
Predict whether the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land after a rocket launch.

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully after launch. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of $62 million, while other providers charge upwards of $165 million per launch. The significant savings are largely due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. By predicting the landing success, we can estimate the cost of a launch, which is useful for companies competing with SpaceX.

## Project Steps

### Data Collection and Preparation
1. **Web Scraping and Data Wrangling**: 
   - Collect data from SpaceX's website using web scraping techniques.
   - Clean and organize the data using Python and Pandas.
   - Convert JSON files into Pandas data frames.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Create scatter plots and bar charts to visualize the data.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis using Python and Pandas.
   - Write and execute SQL queries to sort and filter the data.

### Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards
3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Build interactive dashboards with pie charts and scatter plots using Plotly Dash.
   - Create interactive maps to analyze launch site proximity using the Folium library.

### Predictive Analysis (Classification)
4. **Machine Learning**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train various classification models (SVM, Classification Trees, Logistic Regression).
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best model.
   - Use the best model to predict the landing success of the Falcon 9 first stage.

## Objectives
- Manipulate data using Python and Pandas.
- Convert JSON files into Pandas data frames.
- Share Jupyter notebooks via GitHub.
- Define and solve a real-world business problem using data science.
- Load, clean, and analyze datasets to extract insights.
- Visualize data to identify patterns and guide modeling.
- Build interactive dashboards and maps for data analysis.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for predictive analysis.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly Dash
- Folium
- SQL
- Machine Learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)

This project will help you develop skills in data collection, analysis, visualization, and machine learning, enabling you to predict the landing success of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and assist businesses in making informed decisions.
